            <h2>Welcome to OPA's New Voting Site</h2>
            <p>Welcome to OPA Nu Chapter's new voting site. I don't know what 
            text should go here yet so I'm just gonna type stuff so the page
            doesn't look so empty. Without this text this page would look weird. 
            I also need to see how this font looks in paragraph form. I'm not
            sure if I like it yet. I really like the heading fort, but I can't
            seem to find a body font to go with it. <br><br>
            
            It still looks empty, so I'm gonna keep typing. Maybe I should find
            some image or something to put here to fill the space. Eventually
            I'll talk to Jessica about what she thinks should go here. Maybe a
            list of upcoming votes would be good, though I'm not sure how I
            would go about coding that. But that's what this project is all about, 
            learning. That and saving the exec board some time. </p>
